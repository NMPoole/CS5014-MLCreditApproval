# CS5014 Machine Learning: Credit Approval

This repository demonstrates work completed as part of the **CS5014 Machine Learning** module for Practical 1. A machine learning model has been created that can predict credit card approvals from the described dataset using Logistic Regression. There are two deliverables: the source code for the solution, and a brief report which answers specific questions about the solution.

The aims of this practical were to gain experience in applying machine learning methodology to a real dataset. The submission demonstrates an understanding of:
• How to load, clean, and process a dataset;
• How to train a standard algorithm;
• How to report and interpret the results; and
• How to write clear, concise, and re-usable research code.

The dataset contains two files: _crx.names_ contains the description of the different features in the dataset, while _crx.data_ contains the actual data, in the CSV format. It contains anonymised data pertaining to individual credit card applications, as well as the final outcome (_successful_ or _unsuccessful_). Notice that some of the values are numerical (also referred to as ‘continuous’), and some are categorical. The target variable (outcome of the application) uses ‘+’ for successful and ‘-’ for unsuccessful applications.
